## Examples

Example plugins built with `ts-cli-grpc-plugin`.

Available examples:

- `kv/`: Key-value store plugin used with the upstream Go host example

To add a new example, create a subfolder (e.g., `foo/`) with its own `package.json`, `src/`, and optional `test/` directory. Update this README to list it.
