TypeScript library for writing CLI plugins compatible with HashiCorp's go-plugin (gRPC protocol).

This package exposes small, focused primitives to help you bring up a gRPC server that can speak to a go-plugin host:

- Registers the gRPC Health service and reports SERVING for service "plugin" so the host can probe readiness - Emits the expected handshake line on stdout in the form `CORE|APP|NETWORK|ADDR|grpc` so the host can connect - Optionally wires up the internal `GRPCStdio` and `GRPCController` services when the corresponding protos are present - Lets you register your own gRPC services via a simple callback

The most common entry point is , which binds a local server and writes the handshake line that the host process consumes on stdout. For convenience, is also exported if you need to compute the handshake string manually.
